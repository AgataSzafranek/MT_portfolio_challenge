Hey!
I have decided to take on this challenge because I wanted to check how the theoretical knowledge looked like in practice. I was also really curious to check if my current skills would fit in the role of the manual tester. I have always been fascinated about new apps and love exploring how they work and what can I do with it. Hopefully this challenge will help me find out a little more about this role and take me into right direction with my new career.
